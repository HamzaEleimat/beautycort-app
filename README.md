# BeautyCort - Beauty Booking Platform

**Tagline:** "Book beauty in a blink."

BeautyCort is a mobile-first marketplace that lets women in Jordan—starting with Amman—instantly book salon, spa and aesthetic-medical appointments. We solve the >48-hour "phone-tag" still required to confirm beauty bookings, reducing friction for customers and no-show losses for providers.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Booking beauty and aesthetic services in the MENA region is still largely manual, causing significant friction for both customers and providers:

| Pain Point | Evidence | Impact |
|------------|----------|--------|
| **Manual, delayed booking** | 60% of Amman providers rely on phone/WhatsApp; avg. confirmation >48h | Users give up or book elsewhere |
| **Revenue leakage** | No-shows & late cancels = 15-25% of potential revenue | Significant provider income loss |
